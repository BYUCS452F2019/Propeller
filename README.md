# Propeller
A site to simplify the job search process for CS students.

# Project Description
Students are always looking for job opportunities to make them more competitive when looking for Full-time jobs, but many are overwhelmed by the vast number of job boards they can go to in order to find the right opportunity. I would loike to build a website that makes this experience more enjoyable than it is now.

# Team size
I'm looking for 2-5 others to join my team. The complexity of the project will depend on the team's size!

# SQL
Maybe Postgres?

# No-SQL
I've heard great things about Firebase.

# Business plan
I'm not looking to start a business with this project, but you are welcome to take it over completely after the semester.

# Legal
We'll only need basic information from the users in order to get relevant jobs for them.

# Technical aspects

# UI
I've done Vue and Angular before. But, I'm open to suggestion. I haven't yet thought about how it should look.

# Database Architecture
THe priorities are:

Users
Jobs By Location
Companies in the area 

(Will need to work on this.)
